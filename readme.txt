== Description ==
Increase by 10% the number of Facebook shares and Twitter tweets that your customers do about your business.

[ShareYourCart](http://www.shareyourcart.com/ "Share your cart on social media like facebook and twitter") enables owners to reward their customers for spreading the word about their products / services to their friends, by offering them a coupon code for their purchases, thus helping increase sales conversion

You can choose how much of a discount to give (in fixed amount, percentage, or free shipping) and to which social media channels it should it be applied. You can also define what the advertisement should say, so that it fully benefits your sales.

= Compatibility =
The button is currently fully compatible with:
* WP e-Commerce v3.7+
* eShop v6.2.8+
* WP eStore v3.4.9+
* wpStoreCart v2.5.1+

For other shopping carts, it will fallback to the lite Javascript code.

= Known Issues =
* WP e-Commerce v3.7 as well as eShop v6.2.8+ do not show the ShareYourCart button in the product page
* eShop v6.2.8 and v6.2.9 do not automatically apply the generated coupon to the user's cart, so he has to do it manually

== Installation ==
1. Upload the folder 'shareyourcart' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

It's that easy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

== Screenshots ==

1. The [ShareYourCart](http://www.shareyourcart.com/ "Share your cart on social media like facebook and twitter") button will appear on your website

2. By clicking the button, the customer can choose what type of social media channel to spread the word through. You can adjust the discount (in fixed amount, percentage, or free shipping) as well as how much should be given for each channel. The most important feature is the *message* sent, which you can easilly change to benefit your sales efforts

3. The customer will receive a coupon which he can apply to his cart 

And the best thing is the entire process is automatic, and it simply works.
Thus, you can focus on further building your business, and not on generating coupon codes.
