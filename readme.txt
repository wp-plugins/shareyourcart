ShareYourCart™ helps you get more customers by motivating satisfied customers to talk with their friends about your products. 

== Description ==
[ShareYourCart](http://www.shareyourcart.com/ "Share your cart on social media like facebook and twitter") enables owners to reward their customers for spreading the word about their products / services to their friends, by offering them a coupon code for their purchases, thus helping increase sales conversion

You can choose how much of a discount to give (in fixed amount, percentage, or free shipping) and to which social media channels it should it be applied. You can also define what the advertisement should say, so that it fully benefits your sales.
